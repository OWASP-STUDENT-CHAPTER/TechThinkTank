# BLOCKCHAIN

## Introduction
We all know about the under-the-table corruption and malpractice done by the authorities which end up in a huge amount of black money transactions. Which should be obviously stored in some kind of database, but we can blindly trust that data since we don’t have any access to it or the administration can easily manipulate data. So there will be existing a question regarding the reliability of this centralized system. Right?

Yeah, so this is the reason that the blockchain become a revolutionary technology since blockchain is completely decentralized. That means there is no authority to maintain. Everyone has access and it’s near impossible to change or modify the data in the blockchain. So obviously everyone would prefer to live a corruption-free life with a trustworthy decentralized system like blockchain.

## A Little History

Actually, the research on the blockchain was started in the early ’90s but the proper implementation was done in 2009.

In 2009, An anonymous developer named Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin using blockchain technology. Since then-booming of cryptocurrency began.

## In simple words

Assume a shop, the shopkeeper uses a ledger to store all the financial-related data of the shop. Consider this one ledger as a block that contains a record of data. Each record is a block and the collection of records/blocks are called a blockchain.

If we talk about a single block, it stores data or information. Each block contains

1. A relevant **data**, like in the case of bitcoin the transaction history is the data.
2. **Hash**, we can understand it as a unique fingerprint, just like the biometric we give in order to get an aadhar card number. Similarly, every data you store in the blockchain will generate a random unique hash value.
3. **Previous hash**, this figure is the best way to understand it.

That is each block’s hash is stored in the next block. That’s how the block forms a chain.

*NOTE: The starting block is called the **genesis block**.*

This exemplifies the history of blocks that made blockchain track and maintains effortlessly and it's impossible to manipulate the data since many layers of security are established.

Even if anyone managed to bypass all these securities and change a data, the whole chain of blocks will be affected and become invalid since each block has a unique hash and each hash is stored in the next block. [preffer above image]

If you think you can change all the hashes with the new one. then let me share some amazing stats. In bitcoin 1 block needs 10 minutes to change a hash. so if it’s a chain of 1 crore blocks it will take around 2000+ years to change a hash, which is impossible right?

This function of time is implemented from a concept called Proof of Work. tap here to know more about PoW.

## Domains

If we talk about the different domains where blockchains are used. The first thing that strikes our mind is cryptocurrency. let's take Bitcoin as an example as it is booming and people are crazy about it. The interesting thing is that bitcoin eliminated the middle man (banks) which reduced the transaction fees to minimal as possible. so this is like an asset-to-asset transfer, bitcoin is transferred from bitcoin to bitcoin without any form of conversion of money.

## Use cases

Blockchain can be used in Hospital management systems where the patients data are stored in blockchain and doctors can access the relevant information they need and the patient's data will be kept secured.

we can also use blockchain for projects, Startups and businesses , etc.

Thanks for reading, hope you got a little bit of information about blockchain
